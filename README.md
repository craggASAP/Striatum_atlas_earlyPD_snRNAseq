<p align="justify">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is defined by progressive dopaminergic neuron loss, disrupting the function of dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the basal ganglia. Beyond this, the transcriptional and spatial changes in diverse striatal cell types during PD progression remain unclear. Our study combines spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing in mild and progressive PD mouse models and human postmortem tissue to map the cell-type-specific effects of dopamine degeneration. We found that both neurons and glial cells exhibit significant transcriptomic changes, with glial cells showing early and prominent effects. In mice, oligodendrocytes are the most affected glial population, whereas astrocytes display the greatest alterations in human tissue. A distinct subtype of striatal projection neurons, eccentric SPNs (eSPNs), along with Chst9+ direct-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), exhibit notable resilience to dopamine loss in mouse models and during early Braak pathology in human patients. Interestingly, while Chst9+ dSPNs maintain resilience across all Braak stages and mouse models, eSPNs show increased vulnerability as Braak stages progress and as dopamine depletion advances in the dopamine-specific mitochondrial deficiency model (MitoPark mice). This study highlights the dynamic shifts in cell states within the parkinsonian striatum, offering valuable insights into disease progression and neuronal resilience.This resource establishes the dynamic landscape of cell states in the parkinsonian striatum.</p>

## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts used to (1) analyse and plot single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data for cell-specific transcriptomic changes in the striatum from Parkinson's Disease (PD) mouse models and human tissue; (2) analyse and plot spatial transcriptomics (ST) data to map regional vulnerabilities within the striatum, and perform differential expression for both snRNA-seq data and ST data; and (3) apply computational models for trajectory inference and pseudotime analyse using snRNA seq data. The scripts were custom-written by Marta Graziano from [Meletis Lab](https://ki.se/en/research/research-areas-centres-and-networks/research-groups/konstantinos-meletis-group#tab-research-focus) and Yuvarani Masarapu from [Giacomello Lab](https://www.spatialresearch.org/research-giacomello-lab/) and used in the study "A molecular atlas of cell types in the mouse and human parkinsonian striatum." The scripts from Giacomello Lab are also available on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/giacomellolab/EarlyParkinsons_Striatum_Atlas.git).
